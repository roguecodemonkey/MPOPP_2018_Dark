  Character Setting:
  
  Male protagonist(player character):On behalf of the light. He was finally going to influence the female protagonist.
  Female protagonist(vampire girl):On behalf of the shadow.Because she is a baby, so very simple, no selfish, to the world view is the pursuit of true and beautiful.There is not too much race in her body, there is no deep-rooted species prejudice, so her tolerance of human nature, the ability to receive another civilization is very strong.
  

  Opening: the male character is caught in the dungeon, to be the breakfast of the female character.
  Opening cartoon: the male character is imprisoned in the dungeon, which behind him is female character's greedy smile.Artists should add the sentence:  'The endless darkness is the shadow of light. They can¡¯t co-exist. As one falls, another rises.'

  The ending: under the influence of the male character (in cartoon), the female character gives up the blood of vampire and defies humanity, the spirit of the two is sublimated.The main sublimation of the male is that he has influenced the female.Female's sublimation because she has developed herself,and she gets the true and the beautiful in human nature (no discussion about the hypocrisy in human nature in our game).
  The ending cartoon: On a cliff ,male half squats, looking at the female ,the vampire castle collapse behind the characters.This represents the female to get a new life, to the players to convey a thinking about human nature.

  Statement: The male and female are not the relationship of lovers. They are the relationship between the initiator and the receiver of human nature.Because our work is a game, so Iwant it dramatic.
  We think that not only the game, the meaning of any work is to warn, reflect, comfort.
